Before starting the assignment for Week 5, although I had chosen dbt Cloud in the previous Week 4 assignment, since this assignment required the use of DuckDB, my first task was to install DuckDB locally, which I hadn't done last week.
1 -  First, I ran the `pip install duckdb` command in the terminal to install the duckdb library.

2 - I ran the `pip install dbt-duckdb` command in the Terminal to install DBT's core framework and the DuckDB adapter for DBT.

3 - To configure my dbt profile, I created a folder named .dbt under C:\Users\Esila Nur Demirci and placed the code content given in Step 3 into a file named profiles.yml.

4 - I saved the given Ingest Data Python code as ingest_data.py under C:\05-Data-Platforms and ran it in the terminal with the command `python ingest_data.py`. This downloaded the yellow and green taxi travel parquet files for 2019 and 2020 from the data folder under C:\05-Data-Platforms.

5 - I placed the generated taxi_rides_ny.duckdb file into the same folder as my dbt_project.yml file named taxi_rides_ny, and then ran the dbt debug command in the terminal under C:\05-Data-Platforms\taxi_rides_ny and observed that it worked successfully.

6 - To download the macros and packages (like dbt_utils) for the project to my local computer, I ran the `dbt deps --target prod` command under C:\05-Data-Platforms\taxi_rides_ny and observed that it worked successfully.

 7 - To upload the CSV files from the project to DuckDB as a table, I ran the `dbt seed --target prod` command under C:\05-Data-Platforms\taxi_rides_ny.

8 - I ran the `dbt run --target prod` command under C:\05-Data-Platforms\taxi_rides_ny to start up all the SQL models (transformations of yellow and green taxi data) and create tables in DuckDB.

9 - I observed that all tables were created under the production schema.
