Before starting the assignment for Week 5, although I had chosen dbt Cloud in the previous Week 4 assignment, since this assignment required the use of DuckDB, my first task was to install DuckDB locally, which I hadn't done last week.
1 -  First, I ran the `pip install duckdb` command in the terminal to install the duckdb library.

2 - I ran the `pip install dbt-duckdb` command in the Terminal to install DBT's core framework and the DuckDB adapter for DBT.

3 - To configure my dbt profile, I created a folder named .dbt under C:\Users\Esila Nur Demirci and placed the code content given in Step 3 into a file named profiles.yml.
